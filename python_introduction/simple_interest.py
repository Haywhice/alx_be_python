#Basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

principal = 1000 #$1000
rate = 0.05 #5% annual interest rate
time = 3 #3 years

#simple interest (I = P * R * T)
interest = principal * rate * time
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
